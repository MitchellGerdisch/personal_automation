This folder contains lists of CATs for PFTs.
These files are passed to Catalog_Creation scripts to setup a PFT catalog.
The important lists are:

cats_all_pft.txt: All the CATs that are generally pushed to a PFT.

cats_nonstub_pft.txt: The interesting CATs - ones that actually do something. When asked to push PFT CATs to a customer's account,
one should only bother with these CATs since the stubs are just for show.
