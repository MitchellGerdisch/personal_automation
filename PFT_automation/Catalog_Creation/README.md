This folder contains the main scripts used to setup PFT accounts.

If setting up a single PFT account or pushing CATs to a customer's account, use setup_pft_catalog.sh.
Run it without parameters to see what you need to pass to it.

If pushing updates to many PFT accounts, use the multi_setup_pft_catalogs.sh script.

Run the scripts in the directory in which they reside since they assume the helpers are local.
