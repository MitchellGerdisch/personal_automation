This folder contains scripts used to create users for PFTs.
NOTE: For first time customers/prospects at least one person from the company MUST go through the web-based registration so that they accept the Terms and Conditions.
For that reason, these scripts should be used sparingly and only when you know for sure a company representative has accepted the RightScale license.
If in doubt, don't use.
